These case files are based on [saladfork's case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4486280), which is redistributable under a CC-BY licence. 

(The main reason I chose it was because he kindly provided \*.fcstd files instead of just \*.stl, which are almost impossible to edit.

Changes:
- Removed some side walls to accommodate the addition of a joystick + breakout board.
- Added a hole in the bottom of the case. This takes a M6 bolt to which a Manfrotto tripod can be attached. (It may work with other similar ones, but I haven't had the opportunity to try.) Alternatively, it should also take 1/4"-20 UNC bolts, which fit most camera tripods.
- At some point during file conversion, the M2 holes were expanded and now take M3ish standoffs. (TBD for future versions.)
